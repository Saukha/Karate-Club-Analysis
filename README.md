# Zachary's Karate-Club Graph Analysis

This is an assignment on NetworkX graph analysis.  An unweighted network data of the Zachary's Karate Club was given for analysis.  The graph was visualized to show nodes in different sizes according to how influential or important the node is to the network.  The degree of each node was calculated and the size of each node is proportional to the its degree.

The network was then partitioned using different algorithms to see whether the resulting clusters centered on node 34 and node 1 and whether node 9 stays with node 34 (the administrator of the club) or node 1 (the instructor of the club).  How are these result compared to the results of the original study. Did these algorithm successfully predict who node 9 sided with?
